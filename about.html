        "INNOVATION
        As a company we are passionate about harnessing innovation as a positive force for change. We instil this mindset culturally in every element of our operations and project delivery. We invest heavily in research and development both academically with our university partnerships and at the operational level within our manufacturing and engineering facilities where we put the academic theory into practice".

        RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR
        We take our duty to act responsibly at all times very seriously through proactively managing the impacts of our activities on the environment, our people and the communities in which we operate. We work according to the guiding principles of our founding shareholders and by complying with the high standards set out in our Global Code of Conduct. In particular, we place the safety of those involved in or affected by our operations as our core organisational value, aiming to eliminate all accidents on our projects by 2020. We also take a leading role in driving change across our industry by seeking ways to reduce the effect of our operations on the environment through modernisation of traditional construction methods and practices.

        PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT
        At the heart of our drive to challenge and change the construction industry are our people. We believe in employing and developing the very best talent in the industry, challenging them to find and follow a better way and deliver excellence for our clients whilst leaving a lasting legacy for the communities in which we operate. Every industry needs to nurture talent from an early age and at JB Construction Ltd we support a number of educational initiatives to help promote, engage and educate young people about the rewarding careers to be found within construction and engineering.
