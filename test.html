    “I just wanted to say a BIG thank you to everyone who has worked to complete the build of our new office. From the beginning of the project, with initial site meetings, to the completion the whole team has been very professional, friendly and taken pride in their work which is reflected in our truly amazing office. Due to the nature of our rural office the site has presented many challenges but throughout the whole JB Construction team have been excellent. Thank you on behalf of all the AB Digital staff.”

    “Communication was excellent both ahead of the works at pre-planning stage, during the work and at the snagging stage. Regular communication meant that time keeping was maintained and everyone knew what was happening when. Our environment and its uses were considered ahead of and during the work, ensuring that it did not interfere with day to day work and our needs were met. Staff on site were polite and courteous and were respectful of our staff and building. It has been a very positive experience and staff and I have appreciated the approach and consideration given to us and our place of work. Thank you!”
